# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance

The `February 2001 El Salvador earthquake` struck on February 13, 2001, with a moment magnitude of 6.6, occurring at 8:22 AM local time. The earthquake's epicenter was located 15 miles (30 km) east of San Salvador, El Salvador. This event took place nearly a month after the significant earthquake in January, which affected the same region, though it remains uncertain whether the two events are related. The earthquake impacted several areas, including Cojutepeque, San Mart√≠n, San Vicente, San Salvador, San Miguel, San Juan Tepezontes, Santa Cruz Analquito, and Candelaria in the Department of Cuscatl√°n, while it was also felt across the entire country and in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. The maximum intensity reached MMI VIII, with widespread damage reported in the affected areas. The earthquake tragically resulted in over 280 fatalities and left more than 2600 injured. The economic impact was severe, with losses estimated at over $348 million USD. In addition to the structural damage, the earthquake triggered landslides, particularly in mountainous regions, and caused liquefaction in certain areas. Fortunately, no tsunamis or fires were observed. Numerous aftershocks followed the main event, exacerbating the destruction and complicating ongoing rescue efforts.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
