# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 
The `2019 Yamagata earthquake` struck at 22:22 JST (13:22 UTC) on 18 June 2019 with an estimated magnitude of Mw6.4 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Yamagata_earthquake).

According to official Japanese statistics, the earthquake caused 9 serious injuries and 34 minor injuries. Additionally, 28 houses were partially destroyed and 1,580 partially damaged.


### Type of sequence
No notes of damaging aftershocks were discovered.

### Occurrence of other phenomena: 
Tsunami (up to 10cm)

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
