# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `2010 Chilean earthquake` and tsunami, widely referred to as "27F," struck on February 27, 2010, at 03:34 local time, with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 8.8. The epicenter was located off the coast of the Maule Region, approximately 8 km west of Curanipe. The earthquake reached a maximum intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, significantly impacting regions such as Maule, Biob√≠o, Valpara√≠so, Metropolitana de Santiago, and O'Higgins. It inflicted devastating damage on cities including Concepci√≥n, Talcahuano, Constituci√≥n, and Curic√≥. This catastrophic event resulted in over 480 fatalities and 500‚Äì12000 injuries, with economic losses estimated at over $4000 million USD. The earthquake triggered a series of tsunamis, with wave heights recorded at 2.6 m in Valpara√≠so and 2.34 m in Talcahuano, wreaking additional havoc on coastal areas such as Robinson Crusoe Island. Reports also documented occurrences of liquefaction, landslides, and widespread power outages. The earthquake was accompanied by an extensive aftershock sequence, with over 283 events exceeding magnitude 5.0, including two significant magnitude 7.0 aftershocks near Pichilemu on March 11. This seismic event marked the culmination of a 170-year seismic silence along the subduction zone between the 1960 Valdivia earthquake and the 1985 Valpara√≠so earthquake.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
