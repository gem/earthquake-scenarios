# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `1983 Popay√°n earthquake` occurred on 31 March 1983 at 08:12 AM local time in Popay√°n, Colombia. This earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 5.6, had a significant impact on the region, particularly in Popay√°n, known for its historic and architectural heritage. The epicenter of the earthquake was located southwest of Popay√°n at a depth of 12-15 kilometers. The earthquake caused widespread devastation, especially in Popay√°n, but also affected neighboring towns such as Cajete, Cajib√≠o, Julumito, Figueroa, Rio Hondo, and Santa Ana. Over 13000 buildings were damaged, with more than 2470 houses collapsing. The earthquake resulted in over 200 fatalities, with more than 1200 people injured, and the total economic loss amounted to over $38 million USD. The destruction of local infrastructure, including power outages, water shortages, and communication disruptions, exacerbated the situation. In the aftermath, public health concerns, particularly related to stomach and respiratory issues, began to emerge among survivors. In addition to structural damage, landslides and ground cracks were reported in several affected regions. There were no tsunamis or significant fires, but the area experienced persistent aftershocks that continued until the end of April 1983. The earthquake‚Äôs intensity was classified as MMI VIII, highlighting its devastating effects on the region. As a result of the widespread damage, new regulations were enacted to require earthquake-resistant building materials in regions at risk of seismic activity.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
