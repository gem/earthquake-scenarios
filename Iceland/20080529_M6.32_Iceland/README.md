# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

South Iceland is an active seismic zone. In May 2008 a Mw6.3 earthquake struck the √ñlfus region in South Iceland. The recorded maximum PGA was 0.88g. A great deal of damage occurred but fortunately there was no loss of life

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
