# RECORDING STATIONS

![](recording_stations.png)

A unified database of recording stations is available in `Stations_Unique.csv` file.
When the same station data is found in multiple sources, the information from the highest priority source is preferred to avoid duplication.


## Reference datasets

The reference datasets were used in the following priority order:

- `Stations_CESMD`: Records were downloaded from the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data, [CESMD](http://www.strongmotioncenter.org/). Raw data in Accelerograms_CESMD.zip. Last accessed March 2023.

- `Station_DMG`: Record for DMG station were available from the online material of Bhattarai et al (2015). Bhattarai M, Adhikari LB, Gautam UP, Laurendeau A, Labonne C, Hoste-Colomer R, Sèbe O, Hernandez, B (2015). Overview of the large 25 April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake from accelerometric perspectives. Seismological Research Letters, 86(6):1540-1548. https://doi.org/10.1785/0220150140. Last accessed March 2023.

- `Stations_USGS`: USGS Recording stations. Raw file [stationlist.json](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/product/shakemap/us20002926/atlas/1594162031303/download/stationlist.json). Last accessed March 2023.


## Notes

The event represents the first occurrence of a large continental thrust earthquake to be recorded by high-rate (5-hertz) Global Positioning System (GPS) network very close to and completely encompassing the rupture area (Galetzka_et_al_2015.pdf). The combination of these measurements provides the opportunity to image the kinematics of the source process and the strong ground motion that led to the particular pattern of structural damage observed during this earthquake. Records of displacements and velocities were available, and they were compared to those obtained by a USGS seismic station (KATNP).

Despite being seismically active, a nationwide seismic monitoring network is not available in Nepal (Basu et al., 2021).
