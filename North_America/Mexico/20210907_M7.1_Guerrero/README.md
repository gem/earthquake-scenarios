# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The powerful `2021 Guerrero earthquake` struck near the city of Acapulco in Guerrero state, Mexico, on September 7th at 20:47 local time, with a moment magnitude of Mw7.1. This event exhibited a severe intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, with the epicenter located close to Acapulco, resulting in significant impacts on the city and its surrounding areas. The earthquake caused economic losses exceeding 0.2 million USD, with widespread damage to infrastructure, buildings, and businesses across the region. Tragically, the disaster claimed more than 3 lives, and over 23 individuals sustained injuries. Geophysical effects included landslides that obstructed roads in mountainous regions and liquefaction observed in some coastal areas. While there were no confirmed reports of tsunamis or fires, the earthquake was preceded by minor foreshocks and followed by a series of aftershocks, compounding the challenges faced by affected communities during their recovery efforts.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
