# 🚀 The earthquake at a glance 

The `main shock of the 2012 East Azerbaijan earthquake sequence` occurred on August 11, 2012, with a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum MMI of VII. Striking at 16:53 local time, the epicenter was located near Ahar and Varzaghan, approximately 60 km from Tabriz. This powerful earthquake caused widespread damage in the affected regions, particularly in the cities of Ahar, Varzaghan, and surrounding villages. Landslides were reported in the area, but there were no indications of liquefaction, tsunamis, or fires. The main shock was followed by several aftershocks, continuing to affect the region in the subsequent days.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
