# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `second earthquake in the 2012 East Azerbaijan sequence` occurred on August 11, 2012, with a moment magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum MMI of VIII. It struck shortly after the main shock, at 17:04 local time, with its epicenter near the same area of Ahar and Varzaghan. This aftershock further affected the already impacted regions, including Ahar and Varzaghan, exacerbating the damage and casualties. The event contributed to the overall toll, with additional fatalities and injuries reported. Like the first earthquake, landslides were observed, but there was no liquefaction, tsunamis, or fires. The aftershock continued to disrupt the region, with ongoing aftershocks felt in the following days.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
