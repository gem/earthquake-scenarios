# IMPACT DATA COLLECTION


Information at different administrative levels is collected for the consequences of the event, 
which include building damage, economic losses, and human impact due to the earthquake and its induced effects.

The file `Impact_All_ID_0.csv` provides the national summary of consequences reported by multiple sources.

When information is available at finer resolutions, dedicated files for each administrative level
available are generated for the building and human impact.

- `Impact_Buildings_ID_n.csv`: Damaged building data at administrative level n.
- `Impact_Human_ID_n.csv`: Data of human impact information at administrative level n.

_Note: When available, building-level information is included._


## Metadata

Check the definitions of the parameters used in the impact files in the [impact metadata section](https://gitlab.openquake.org/risk/ecd/-/blob/main/metadata.md#impact-data).


## Notes

- Information in different administrative regions is not available.

- The earthquake caused 2 deaths and damaged 170 educational centers in Costa Rica. These were in the epicentral zone and suspended classes for the remainder of the 2012 school year to make way for repairs. 1054 houses with some type of damage were registered, of which 60 were totally destroyed. The most damaged building was the Monseñor Sanabria Hospital, which had large cracks in its structure as well as the total collapse of the parts of the building made of unreinforced masonry. 
The National Commission of Emergencies declared that 1474 people were mobilized due to the earthquake. This includes evacuations from hospitalized patients, uncommunicated communities, and preemptive evacuations. 
The electricity and drinking water services were interrupted in the areas near the epicenter. Electricity was 100 percent restored after the event while drinking water took a few days to replenish, as pipes were damaged by the earthquake.
The distribution of houses in different damaged states can be found in the `CNE_2012` reference.

- Estimated economic losses are not indicated in the consulted references and databases.

- The distribution of damaged houses at `Adm 2` can be found in the reference `CNE_2012`. Most structures suffered moderate damage.
