# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `1990 Manjil‚ÄìRudbar earthquake` occurred on Thursday, June 21, 1990 at 00:30:14 local time in northern Iran. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a Mercalli Intensity of X (Extreme) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Manjil%E2%80%93Rudbar_earthquake)). Widespread damage occurred to the northwest of the capital city of Tehran, including the cities of Rudbar and Manjil. The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) estimated that $8 billion in damage occurred in the affected area. Other earthquake catalogs presented estimates of the loss of life in the range of 35000‚Äì50000, with a further 60000‚Äì105000 that were injured. Moreover, there was approximately 105000‚Äì400000 displaced population.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
