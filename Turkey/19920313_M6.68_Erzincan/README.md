# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

On 13 March, at 7:19 pm, the 1992 Erzincan earthquake struck eastern Turkey with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Erzincan_earthquake). Originating on the North Anatolian Fault, the epicentre was located less than 8 kilometers away from Erzincan's central business district. Damage was extensive both in the Erzincan district and province. Four aftershocks ranging from 5.0 to 6.1 Mw were registered according to the Ministry of Public works and settlements.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
