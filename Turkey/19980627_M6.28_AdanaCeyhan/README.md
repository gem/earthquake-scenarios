# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The 1998 Adana‚ÄìCeyhan earthquake occurred at 16:55 local time on 27 June with a moment magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum intensity of IX (Destructive) on the European macroseismic scale. The total economic loss was estimated at about US$1 billion.
The event occurred in Cilicia region in southern Turkey and killed at least 145 people and left 1,500 people wounded and many thousands homeless in Adana, and Ceyhan, the most populous town of the Adana Province, as well as many villages located between both cities along the Ceyhan River. The most casualties and damage occurred due to inadequately engineered buildings in the town of Ceyhan.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
