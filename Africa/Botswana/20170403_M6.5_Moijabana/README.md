# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 
The `2017 Moijabana earthquake` struck at 19:40 local time on 3 April 2017 with an estimated magnitude of Mw6.5 and severe (VIII) shaking in a rural area of Botswana. There are no reported deaths from this earthquake and 36 reported injuries, however the injuries were from a stampede that was triggered by the earthquake.

### Type of sequence
At least 30 M>3 events were reported following the main shock (ISC).


### Occurrence of other phenomena: 
Stampede

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
