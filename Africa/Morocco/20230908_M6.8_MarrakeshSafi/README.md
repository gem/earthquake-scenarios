# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The 2023 Marrakesh‚ÄìSafi earthquake struck Morocco on September 8, 2023, at 11:11 PM local time. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.8 and reached a maximum intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. The epicenter was located near the town of Al Haouz, about 70 kilometers southwest of Marrakesh, in the High Atlas Mountains. The earthquake primarily affected the regions of Marrakesh, Al Haouz, and Taroudant, with significant damage in the city of Marrakesh. The event caused widespread devastation, resulting in approximately 2900 fatalities and over 5500 injuries. In addition to the primary shaking, there were reports of landslides in the mountainous areas, though no tsunamis or large-scale fires were observed. Liquefaction was not prominently reported, but the extensive destruction of buildings raised concerns over the resilience of the region‚Äôs infrastructure.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
