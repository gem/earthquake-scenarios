# 🚀 The earthquake at a glance 

A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 struck northwestern Albania at 02:54 local time on November 26, 2019. The epicentre was located 16 kilometres west-southwest of Mamurras. The earthquake reached a maximum intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, causing severe damage in the cities of Durrës, Thumanë, and nearby areas. Tragically, the disaster claimed 51 lives and left over 913 people injured, while inflicting significant economic losses estimated at approximately $700 million USD. Instances of liquefaction were observed in several locations, although no landslides, tsunamis, or fires were reported. The event was preceded by foreshocks, including a magnitude 5.6 earthquake two months earlier, and was followed by numerous aftershocks, exacerbating the devastation and challenges faced by the affected communities.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
