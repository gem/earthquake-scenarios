# 🚀 The earthquake at a glance 

The `2011 Lorca earthquake`, a magnitude 5.1 event, struck southeastern Spain on May 11, 2011, at 18:47 local time. Its epicenter was located near the town of Lorca. The earthquake caused significant damage, particularly to older structures, resulting in around 9 fatalities and over 320 injuries. Economic losses were substantial, exceeding 700 million EUR. The earthquake's intensity reached a maximum of VI on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
