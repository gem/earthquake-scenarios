# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `1990 Carlentini earthquake` struck on December 13, 1990, at 01:24 local time, shaking southeastern Sicily with a magnitude of 5.6. The event reached a maximum intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, causing widespread destruction. The epicenter was located approximately 20 kilometers east-northeast of Augusta, near the town of Carlentini, which, along with Augusta, bore the brunt of the disaster. The earthquake claimed the lives of 17 people, left over 200 injured. The economic losses exceeded $115 million USD, highlighting the scale of the destruction. Despite the severity, there were no reported cases of liquefaction, tsunamis, or landslides.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
