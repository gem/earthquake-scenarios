# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The 1990 Carlentini earthquake (Italian: Terremoto di Carlentini del 1990) occurred off the Sicilian coast, 20 km east northeast from the town of Augusta, Sicily on 13 December at 01:24 local time. The moderately-sized earthquake measuring 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw‚ÄØ) resulted in the deaths of 19 people and caused at least 200 injuries. It also inflicted significant damage in the region, leaving 2,500 homeless.
Lasting 45 seconds, the shock was assigned a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VII‚ÄìVIII (Very strong‚ÄìSevere). The earthquake was followed-up by four aftershocks that were felt by people.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
