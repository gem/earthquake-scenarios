# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The 2011 Van earthquakes occurred in eastern Turkey near the city of Van. The first earthquake happened on 23 October at 13:41 local time. The shock had a Mw magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). It occurred at a shallow depth, causing heavy shaking across much of eastern Turkey and lighter tremors across neighboring parts of the South Caucasus and Levant. A separate earthquake within the same earthquake system happened on 9 November at 21:23 local time (19:23 UTC). The event had multiple aftershoks, over 7 of these have been greater than magnitude 5, including a M5.6 and M5.9 soon after the quake, a M6.0, 10 hours after the earthquake, and a M5.7 which caused much additional damage including collapsed houses

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
