# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `2011 Van earthquake`, a magnitude 7.1 event, struck eastern Turkey on October 23, 2011, at 13:41 local time. The maximum Mercalli intensity reached VIII. The epicenter was located near the city of Van. This powerful earthquake caused widespread devastation, particularly in the cities of Van and Erci≈ü. The death toll was tragically high, with over 600 fatalities and 2600 injuries reported. Economic losses were nearly 1500 million USD, and the earthquake triggered numerous landslides and some localized liquefaction.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
