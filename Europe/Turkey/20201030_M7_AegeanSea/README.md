# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `2020 Aegean Sea earthquake`, a magnitude 7.0 event, struck the eastern Aegean Sea on October 30, 2020, at 14:51 local time. The maximum Mercalli intensity reached VIII. The epicenter was located in the Aegean Sea, between the Greek islands of Samos and Ikaria. This powerful earthquake caused significant damage in both Greece and Turkey. The most affected cities included ƒ∞zmir in Turkey and Samos Town in Greece. The death toll exceeded 117, with over 1000 injuries reported. Economic losses were around 400 million USD, and the earthquake triggered numerous landslides and some localized liquefaction. A small tsunami, with waves up to 1.5 meters, was observed in some coastal areas.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
