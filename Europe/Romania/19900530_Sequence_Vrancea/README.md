# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `1990 Vrancea earthquake` occurred on May 30, 1990, at 13:40 local time in Romania. The epicenter was located near the town of Foc»ôani, in the Vrancea seismic region. This powerful earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 7.0, was felt in Bucharest, BacƒÉu, and other areas in southeastern Romania, as well as in parts of neighboring Moldova. The earthquake caused significant damage, particularly in Bucharest, where many buildings were affected. The Maximum Intensity (MMI) was reported as VIII, and it resulted in more than 9 fatalities and over 700 injuries. The economic losses were substantial, amounting to an estimated $23.7 million USD. While no tsunamis were observed, the event triggered landslides and liquefaction in some areas, and fires were reported due to ruptured gas lines. The earthquake was part of a seismic sequence, followed by several aftershocks that continued to impact the region for weeks, further complicating rescue efforts. There were no significant foreshocks recorded before the main event.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
