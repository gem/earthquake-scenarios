# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The mainshock of the 2014 Kefalonia earthquake occurred on January 26, 2014, at 15:55 local time. It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was centered near Kefalonia Island in the Ionian Sea. The earthquake caused widespread damage, especially in the cities of Lixouri and Argostoli, with a Maximum Mercalli Intensity (MMI) of VIII. This earthquake was the start of a sequence of seismic events that affected the region for several weeks.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Consequences

The information collected for the consequences of the event and the corresponding references is available in the [Impact](./Impact) folder. When available, information at different geographical levels is provided considering the building damage, economic losses and human impact.

A summary of the main consequences of the event is available in the [earthquake_information.csv](./earthquake_information.csv) file.
