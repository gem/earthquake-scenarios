# 🚀 The earthquake at a glance 

The `2014 Kefalonia earthquake` sequence began with a mainshock on January 26, 2014, at 15:55 local time, with a magnitude of 6.1. The epicenter was located near Kefalonia Island in the Ionian Sea, affecting cities like Lixouri and Argostoli. The earthquake caused significant damage with a Maximum Mercalli Intensity (MMI) of VIII, leading to around 175 million USD in economic losses and at least 23 injuries. Liquefaction was observed, but tsunamis and large landslides were not. The sequence continued with a strong aftershock on February 3, 2014, of magnitude 6.0, causing further damage, particularly to weakened structures, with aftershocks continuing for weeks.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum recorded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was [insert value here], observed at [insert location here]. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
