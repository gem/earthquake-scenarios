# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The 1995 Aigio earthquake struck Western Greece near the coastal city of Aigio at 03:15:48 local time on 15 June. The earthquake measured 6.4‚Äì6.5 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw‚ÄØ). Significant destruction occurred; building collapses left 26 dead and up to 200 injured. The earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), and EMS-98 intensity of IX (Destructive). The horizontal peak ground acceleration reached 0.54 g,
and ground velocity peaked at 52 cm/s (20 in/s)‚Äîthe strongest ground motion ever recorded in Greece. Monetary damages reached $660 million (in 1995 USD). Only 15 minutes after the mainshock struck, a large aftershock caused more damage to Aigio. In the aftermath, several countries and organizations provided disaster aid, including search and rescue and refugee assistance operations. Faulting took place on either the Aigion fault or an unnamed offshore fault. Other faults in the region have the potential to produce earthquakes up to Mw‚ÄØ 6.9, which poses a risk to Aigio and the rest of the Gulf of Corinth.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
