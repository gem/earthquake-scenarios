A unified database of recording stations is available in `Stations_Unique.csv` file.
When the same station data is found in multiple sources, the information from the highest priority source is preferred to avoid duplication.


## Reference datasets

The reference datasets were used in the following priority order:

- `Stations_SGC`: Seismic data provided have been the product of the instrumentation and processing work of the Seismic Instrumentation prepared by the Colombian Geological Service (SGC). Raw data in [`SGC_Recording_Stations.zip`](http://bdrsnc.sgc.gov.co/paginas1/catalogo/index_rnac.php). Last accessed July 2022.
