# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

This is a list of earthquakes in 2004. Only earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above are included, unless they resulted in significant damage or casualties, or were notable for some other reason. All dates are listed according to UTC time. The year 2004 had the most major earthquakes since 1999. In total, there were 16 magnitude 7.0+ earthquakes this year, 6 of them were in Indonesia. Most of the earthquake deaths in 2004 were caused by the magnitude 9.1‚Äì9.3 earthquake 
off the west coast of Sumatra on December. Most of the deaths were caused by a devastating tsunami that spread across the Indian Ocean. There were several other deadly and destructive earthquakes, including Morocco's largest earthquake to date, which caused 628 deaths. Japan was hit by a magnitude 6.6 earthquake, which caused 68 deaths and $28 billion in damages, making it the fourth costliest earthquake in history.

## Ground shaking

The estimation of the ground shaking has The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) stores the required input files to generate the ground motion fields considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, when available. The figures below present an example of the results, showing the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning the ground shaking for the rupture and ground motion model that indicates the lowest nominal bias.
