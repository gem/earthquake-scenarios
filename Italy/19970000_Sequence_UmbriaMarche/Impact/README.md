# IMPACT DATA COLLECTION


Information at different administrative levels is collected for the consequences of the event, 
which include building damage, economic losses, and human impact due to the earthquake and its induced effects.

The file `Impact_All_ID_0.csv` provides the national summary of consequences reported by multiple sources.

When information is available at finer resolutions, dedicated files for each administrative level
available are generated for the building and human impact.

- `Impact_Buildings_ID_n.csv`: Damaged building data at administrative level n.
- `Impact_Human_ID_n.csv`: Data of human impact information at administrative level n.

_Note: When available, building-level information is included._


## Metadata

Check the definitions of the parameters used in the impact files in the [impact metadata section](https://gitlab.openquake.org/risk/ecd/-/blob/main/metadata.md#impact-data).


## Notes

For this particular event most of the building damage data was collected and aggregated from information obtained from [Da.DO Database di Danno Osservato](https://egeos.eucentre.it/danno_osservato/web/danno_osservato#:~:text=Essa%20%C3%A8%20stata%20concepita%20per,crisi%20sismiche%20di%20rilevanza%20nazionale.) (Database of Observed Damage) from the Civil Protection Department, developed by Eucentre.
